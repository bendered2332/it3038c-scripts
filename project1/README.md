# Project 1

I wrote this project because Halloween is coming up and it will help me keep track of how many days I have left to complete my outfit. I also included a countdown till my birthday, which is August 23rd.

To run this program, make sure that Python3 is installed and working. You can validate this by running in your command prompt on Windows or Linux:

```bash
python --version
```

If using Linux, you may need to specify Python3
```bash
python3 --version
```

Now, from the project1 directory, run the program using Python

```bash
python Halloween-counter.py
```
